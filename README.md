# KS - Skull Script

**KS (Skull Script)** is a simple yet powerful transpiled language that compiles down to JavaScript. Our goal is to combine simplicity with powerful features, making it a practical choice for scripting in the browser.

## Project Goals

1. **Type Checking**: Implement robust type-checking mechanisms to ensure reliability and catch errors early.
2. **Improved IDE Support**: Enhance development experience with better IDE integration, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools.
3. **Feature Expansion**: Continuously add new, useful features to make KS more versatile and developer-friendly.

## Current Status

The Skull Script transpiler converts KS code into JavaScript, preserving the intended structure and logic while maintaining readability in the output code. We are actively working on adding more features to improve performance and usability.

## How to Get Involved

We welcome contributions to KS! Whether you want to help with bug fixes, feature implementation, or documentation, your input is valuable to us.
